In computer science, k-way merge algorithms or multiway merges are a specific type of sequence merge algorithms that specialize in taking in k sorted lists and merging them into a single sorted list. 
These merge algorithms generally refer to merge algorithms that take in a number of sorted lists greater than two.
Two-way merges are also referred to as binary merges.The k- way merge is also an external sorting algorithm.

In this example we read a large random number input text file, sort it and write to output text file.

Use k-way merge when:

You need to combine multiple sorted arrays or lists
